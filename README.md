# Relationship-Goals
Machine Learning algorithm for determining whether couples will stay together using atypical data. The data is non-standard because unlike dating websites that match based on personalities or interests, this dataset contains information about age, race, religion, income, political views, basic living conditions, family, etc..

## Data
Data from a Stanford Study: How Couples Meet and Stay Together (HCMST) Stanford Social Science Data Collection https://exhibits.stanford.edu/data/catalog/ns183dp7831.

## Goals
1) Determine whether we can predict if couples will stay together using this data.
2) If it is possible to predict, what features of the data are important to relationship stability.
3) Potentially attempt to predict the length of a relationship.

## Models
